# A modicum of measure theory


## Roadmap

Performing stochastic modeling in a comfortable way requires
consistent foundations and notation. In this chapter, we set the stage
for further development. Probability theory started as the interaction
between combinatorics and games of chance (XVIIth century). At that time,
the set of outcomes was finite, and it was legitimate to think that
any set of outcomes had a well-defined probability. When
mathematicians started to perform stochastic modeling in different branches of
sciences (astronomy, thermodynamics, genetics, ...), they had to handle uncountable sets of outcomes.
Designing a sound definition of what a probability distribution is, took time.
Progress in integration and measure theory during the XIXth century and
the early decades of the XXth century led to the modern, measure-theoretical
foundation of probability theory.

## Universe, powerset and $\sigma$-algebras  {#tribe}

A _universe_ is a set (of possible _outcomes_) we decide to call a universe. The universe is often denoted by $\Omega$. Generic elements of $\Omega$  (outcomes) are denoted by $\omega$.

<br><p></p>

```{example universe}
If we think of throwing a dice as a random phenomenon, the set of outcomes is the set of labels on the faces $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.  If we are throwing two dices, the set of outcomes is made of
couples of labels $\Omega' = \{(1,1), (1, 2), (1, 3), \ldots, (6,6)\} =\Omega^2$.
```

<br><p></p>


```{example unverse-hashing}
In the idealized hashing problem (Section \@ref(hashing)), the universe is  the set of functions from $1, \ldots, n$ to $1, \ldots, m$. The size of the universe is $m^n$.
```

<br><p></p>

A universe may or may not be finite or countable. If the universe is countable, all its subsets may be  called _events_. Events are assigned probabilities.
If the universe is countable, it is possible to assign a probability  to each of its subsets.
When the universe  is not countable (for example $\mathbb{R}$), Assigning a probability
to all subsets is not possible. We have to  restrict  the  collection of subsets in order to assign probabilities to the collection members in a consistent way.

In the sequel $2^{\Omega}$ denotes the collection of all subsets of $\Omega$ (the powerset of $\Omega$).

A sensible collection of events has to be a $\sigma$-algebra.

<br><p></p>

```{definition sigalgebra, name="$\\sigma$-algebra"}
Given a set $\Omega$, a collection $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ ($\mathcal{G} \subseteq 2^{\Omega}$) is called a  $\sigma$-algebra (a sigma  algebra) iff

- $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under $countable$ union
- $\emptyset \in \mathcal{G}$
- $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under complementation ($A \in \mathcal{G} \Rightarrow A^c = \Omega \setminus A \in \mathcal{G}$)

```

<br><p></p>


```{exercise}
What the smallest $\sigma$-algebra (with respect to set inclusion)
that contains subset $A$ of $\Omega$?
```

<br><p></p>

The next proposition shows that $\sigma$-algebras are stable
under countable set-theoretical operations. We could have replaced
countable union by countable intersection in the definition of $\sigma$-algebras.
This is consequence of De Morgan's laws:

\[
(A \cup B)^c  = A^c \cap B^c \qquad \text{and} (A \cap B)^c  = A^c \cup B^c
\]

```{proposition}
A $\sigma$-algebra of subsets is closed under countable intersections.
```

<br><p></p>


```{proof}
For $A \subseteq \Omega$, let $A^c = \Omega \setminus A$.
Let $A_1, \ldots, A_n, \ldots$ belong to $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets
of $\Omega$. For each $n$, $A_n^c \in \mathcal{G}$, by definition of $\sigma$-algebra,
\begin{align*}
\cap_n A_n
 & = \Big(\big(\cap_n A_n\big)^c\Big)^c \\
 & = \Big(\cup_n A_n^c\Big)^c  \qquad \text{De Morgan} \, .
\end{align*}
By definition of a $\sigma$-algebra, $\cup_n A_n^c \in \mathcal{G}$, and
for the same reason, $\Big(\cup_n A_n^c \Big)^c \in \mathcal{G}$.
```

<br><p></p>

The next proposition allows us to talk about the smallest $\sigma$-algebra
containing a collection of subsets, this leads to the notion
of generated $\sigma$-algebra.

<br><p></p>


```{proposition}
The intersection of two $\sigma$-algebras of subsets of $\Omega$
is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Omega$.
```


<br><p></p>


```{proof}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G}'$ be two $\sigma$-algebras of subsets
of $\Omega$. The intersection of the two $\sigma$-algebras is
\[
\Big\{ A : A\subseteq \Omega, A \in \mathcal{G}, A \in \mathcal{G}' \Big\}\, .
\]
```

<br><p></p>

Indeed, the intersection of a possibly uncountable collection of $\sigma$-algebras
is a $\sigma$-algebra (check this).
Because of this property, the notion of a $\sigma$-algebra generated by a collection of subsets is well-founded.

```{lemma gensigma}
Given a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of $\Omega$, there exists a _unique smallest $\sigma$-algebra_ containing all subsets
in $\mathcal{C}$, it is called the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{H}$ and denoted by $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$.

```

<br><p></p>

```{exercise}
Check the preceding proposition.
```

<br><p></p>

```{example}
Consider we are throwing a dice, $\Omega = \{1, \ldots, 6\}$, let $$\mathcal{H} = \Big\{\{1, 3, 5\}\Big\}\, .$$ This is a collection made of one event (the outcome  is odd). The algebra generated by $\mathcal{H}$ is $$\sigma(\mathcal{H}) = \Big\{ \{1, 3, 5\}, \{2, 4, 6\}, \emptyset, \Omega \Big\} \, .$$
```

<p>
Two kinds of $\sigma$-algebras play a prominent role in a basic probability course:

1. the powerset of countable or finite sets.
1. the Borel $\sigma$-algebras of  topological spaces.

<p>


```{definition, name="Borel sigma-algebra"}
The Borel $\sigma$-algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated
by _open_ sets. It is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$.
```

<p>
This definition works for every topological space. Recall that a topology
on a set $E$ is defined by a collection $\mathcal{E}$ of _open sets_. This collection
is defined by the following list of properties:

- $\emptyset, E \in \mathcal{E}$
- A (_possibly uncountable_) union of elements of $\mathcal{E}$ (open sets)
belongs to $\mathcal{E}$ (is an open set)
- A finite intersection of open sets is an open set.

In the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, a set $A$ is open if for any $x \in A$, there
exists some $r>0$ such that $]x-r, x+r[ \subseteq A$. Any interval of the form $]a,b[$
is open (these are the so-called open intervals).

This topology can be generalized to any finite dimension $\mathbb{R}^d$.
<p>

```{exercise}
Consider the $\sigma$-algebra generated by open-intervals of $\mathbb{R}$.
Is it the Borel $\sigma$-algebra?
```

```{exercise}
Consider the $\sigma$-algebra generated by open-intervals of $\mathbb{R}$ with rational bounds.
Is it the Borel $\sigma$-algebra?
```

```{exercise}
Consider any metric space $(E,d)$. The metric $d$ defines a topology on $E$.
Does the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on $(E, d)$ coincide with the
$\sigma$-algebra generated by open balls $B(x,r) = \Big\{  y : y\in E, d(x,y)<r\Big\}$?
```

We are now ready to set the stage of stochastic modeling. The playground
always consists of a measurable space.

```{definition,  measspace, name="Measurable space"}
A universe $\Omega$ endowed with a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets $\mathcal{F}$
is called a measurable space. It is denoted by $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.
```

<p>

```{example}

- If $\Omega$ is a countable or finite set, then $(\Omega, 2^\Omega)$ is
a measurable space.
- If $\Omega=\mathbb{R}$, then $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}({\mathbb{R}}))$ is a measurable space.

```

So far, we have not talked about probability theory, but,
we are now equipped to define probability distributions and to manipulate them.



## Probability distributions  {#distribution}


A _probability distribution_ maps a $\sigma$-algebra to $[0,1]$. It is
an instance of a more general concept called a _measure_. We state or recall
important concept of measure theory. The key idea underneath the elaboration of measure theory
is that we should refrain from trying to measure _all_ subsets of a universe (unless this universe
is countable). Attempts to measure all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ lead to paradoxes and of little
practical use. Measure theory starts by recognizing the desirable properties any useful measure
should possess, then measure theory builds objects satisfying these properties on as large as possible
$\sigma$-algebras of events, for example on Borel $\sigma$-algebras.

This motivates the definition of $\sigma$-additivity.

```{definition, sigadd, name="sigma-additivity"}
Given  $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^\Omega$, a function $\mu$ mapping
$\mathcal{A}$ to $[0,\infty)$ is said to be $\sigma$-_additive_  on $\mathcal{A}$ if for any countable collection of _pairwise disjoint_ subsets $(A_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{A}$,
with $\cup_n A_n \in \mathcal{A}$ we have
$$\mu (\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mu(A_n)  \, .$$
```

Note that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, $\Big(\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n\Big) \in \mathcal{F}$.
$\sigma$-additivity fits well  with $\sigma$-algebras, but it makes sense to
define $\sigma$-additivity with respect to more general collections of subsets.

<br><p></p>


```{definition, pmeasure, name="Positive measure"}
Given a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, a $\sigma$-additive function $\mu$ mapping
$\mathcal{F}$ to $[0,\infty)$ and satisfying $\mu(\emptyset)=0$
is called a  _positive measure_ over $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.

The tuple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is called a measure space.
```
<p>

```{exercise, fundspace}
Let $\Omega = \{0,1\}^*$ the set of infinite sequences of $0$ and $1$ (indexed
  from $1$).
Let $\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq 2^\Omega$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated by
events of the following form: $\{ \omega : \omega \in \Omega, \omega_i = 1\}$
for $1\leq i\leq n$.

- Define a $\sigma$-additive function on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}_n)$.
- What is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\cup_{n\geq 1} \mathcal{F}_n$?
- Can you define a $\sigma$-additive function on $(\Omega, \sigma(\cup_{n\geq 1} \mathcal{F}_n))$.

```
<p>
A positive measure $\mu$ is not necessarily a probability distribution. For example,
the _counting measure_ $\mu$ on $\mathbb{N}$  satisfies $\mu(A) = |A|$ for all $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, so we have $\mu(\mathbb{N})=\infty.$


<p>

```{definition, probmeasure, name="Probability distribution"}
Given a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, a function $\mu$ mapping
$\mathcal{F}$ to $[0,\infty)$ is a probability distribution over $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$  if

1. $\mu$ is a positive measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$  and
1. $\mu(\Omega)=1$.

```


```{exercise}
 If you think $(\mathbb{R}, 2^{\mathbb{R}})$ is a measurable space, define a $\sigma$-additive measure on it.
 Try even to define a probability measure.
```


```{remark}
The notion of $\sigma$-additivity is stronger than finite additivity.
Assuming the \emph{Axiom of Choice} (as usual when working in Analysis or Probability), there exists a function $\mu$
that map  $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ to $[0,1]$, that is  additive ($\mu(A \cup B)= \mu(A) + \mu(B)$ for all $A, B, A\cap B=\emptyset$),
zero on all finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and such that $\mu(\mathbb{N})=1$. Such a function is not $\sigma$-additive.
```

## Lebesgue measure {#lebesgue}


<p>

We take the existence of Lebesgue's measure for granted. This is the content of the next theorem.

<p>

```{theorem lebesgue, name="Existence of Lebesgue's measure"}
There exists a unique $\sigma$-additive measure $\ell$ on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$
such that $\ell((a, b]) = b - a$ for all finite $a < b$.
```

<p>
Theorem \@ref(thm:lebesgue) is typical of statements of measure theory. It defines a complex object
(a measure) by its trace on a simple collection of sets (intervals).

The proof of Theorem \@ref(thm:lebesgue) can be cut in several meaningful pieces. First define
a length function on intervals. Show that this function can be extended to
an additive function on finite union, finite intersection and complements of intervals.
Then check that the extension is in fact $\sigma$-additive on the closure
of  intervals under finite set-theoretical operations (which is not a $\sigma$-algebra).

Once this additive extension is constructed, use Carathéodory's extension theorem below
to prove that the length function can be extended to a $\sigma$-additive function
on the $\sigma$-algebra generated by intervals (the Borel $\sigma$-algebra).

Then it remains to check that the extension is unique. This can be done by a generating
set argument, for example the _monotone class Lemma_ (Lemma \@ref(thm:monotoneclasslemma)).

```{theorem caratheodory, name="Carathéodory's extension theorem"}
Let $\mathcal{A} \subseteq 2^{\Omega}$. Assume $\mathcal{A}$ contains $\emptyset, \Omega$, and
is closed  under finite unions, and complementation. Assume $\rho : \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$
is $\sigma$-additive on $\mathcal{A}$.

Then there exists a measure $\mu$  on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ such that $\mu(A)=\rho(A)$
for all $A \in \mathcal{A}$.
```

The Lebesque measure existence theorem guarantees that we can define
the uniform probability distribution over a finite interval $[a,b]$. If
we denote Lebesgue measure by $\ell$, the uniform probability distribution
over $[a,b]$ assign probability \[
P(A) = \frac{\ell(A)}{b-a} = \frac{\ell(A)}{\ell([a,b])}
\] to any $A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \cap [a,b]$.


<br><p></p>

The uniform distribution over $([0,1], \mathcal{B}([0,1]))$ looks like
an academic curiosity with no practical utility. This superficial opinion should be dispelled.
Using a generator for the uniform distribution, it is possible to build
a generator for any probability distribution over $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.
This can be done using a device called the _quantile transform_. In this sense,
the uniform distribution is the mother of all distribution.

An outcome $\omega$ of the uniform distribution is a real number. How does a
typical outcome look? A real number $\omega \in [0,1]$ has binary expansions: $\omega = \sum_{i=1}^\infty b_i 2^{-1}$
with $b_i \in \{0,1\}$. What is the probability there is a unique binary expansion?
First, check whether this probability is well-defined.
Assuming  the binary expansion is unique, $\omega$ is said to be _normal_  if
$\lim_n \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(\omega) = 1/2$. Is the probability of obtaining a normal number
well-defined? If yes, compute it.

<br><p></p>

```{exercise}
Check that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \cap [a,b] =  \Big\{ A \cap [a,b] : A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}) \Big\}$
is the $\sigma$-algebra generated  by the trace of the usual topology if $\mathbb{R}$ on $[a,b]$.
```

The Lebesgue existence theorem can be extended. Indeed, any sensible
definition of the length of an interval can serve as a starting point.

Recall that a real function is CADLAG if it is right-continuous everywhere,
and has left-limits everywhere.

The next Theorem can be established in a way that parallels the construction
of Lebesgue's measure.

<br><p></p>

```{theorem dudley3-1-3}
Any non-decreasing CADLAG function $F$ on $\mathbb{R}$ defines a $\sigma$-additive
measure $\mu$ on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ that satisfies:
$$\mu((a, b]) = F(b) - F(a)$$.
```



<br><p></p>

We recover Lebesgue's existence Theorem by taking $F(x)=x$.

If we focus on functions $F$ that satisfy $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x)=0$
and $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x)=1$, Theorem \@ref(thm:dudley3-1-3) defines
probability distributions through their _cumulative distribution functions_
(more on this topic in Section \@ref(distribfun)).

<br><p></p>

```{exercise}
Do we really to assume that the function $F$ has left-limits in Theorem \@ref(thm:dudley3-1-3)?
```

<br><p></p>


## Measurable functions and random variables {#measurablefunctionsrv}

So far, we only talked probability and measure of sets (events). As
stochastic modeling is at the root of quantitative analysis, we introduce
the notion of measurable function.
This allows us handle numerical functions that map outcomes to $\mathbb{R}$
or $\mathbb{R}^d$.

Not every numerical function is  measurable. To define what we call a measurable
function, we need the notion of _inverse image_  or _preimage_.

```{definition preimage, name="Preimage"}
Let $f$ be a function from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{Y}$, we denote by $f^{-1}$
the function that maps $2^{\mathcal{Y}}$ to $2^{\mathcal{X}}$ defined by
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}: \qquad 2^{\mathcal{Y}} & \rightarrow  2^{\mathcal{X}} \\
B & \mapsto f^{-1}(B) = \Big\{ x : x \in \mathcal{X}, f(x) \in B \Big\} \, .
\end{align*}
The set $f^{-1}(B)$ is called the _preimage_ or _inverse image_ of $B$ under $f$.
```
<br><p></p>

```{block}
Note that
$f^{-1}$ does not denote the inverse of function $f$ which may not be injective.
In this course,  $f^{-1}$ is a set function from the powerset of
the codomain of $f$ to the powerset of the domain of $f$. The inverse function
if it exists (or the generalized inverse function) is denoted by $f^\leftarrow$.
The inverse function, when it exists, maps $f(\mathcal{X})\subseteq \mathcal{Y}$ to
$\mathcal{X}$.
```

<p>


```{example}
Recall the idealized hashing setting from Section \@ref(hashing).
Let $\Omega$ denote the set of functions from $1, \ldots, n$  to $1, \ldots, m$
(assume $n \leq m$). For $\omega \in \Omega$ ($\omega$ is function, but it
is also a $1, \ldots, m$-valued sequence of length $n$), let $f(\omega)$ be the
number of values in $1, \ldots, m$ that have no occurrence in $\omega$
(the number of empty bins in the allocation defined by $\omega$).  The function
$f$ is a numerical function that maps $\Omega=\{1, \ldots, m\}^n$ .
For $B \in \mathbb{N}$, $f^{-1}(B)$ is the subset of allocations
which have $k$ empty bins, $k \in B$.
```

The preimage operation works well with set-theoretical operations.

Elementary properties of measurable functions follow from properties of
inverse images. Inverse image preserves set-theoretical operations.

```{proposition  propinvimage}
Let $f: E \mapsto F$, then for $A, B, A_1, \ldots,A_n , \ldots   \subseteq F$,
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}(A \cup B) & = f^{-1}(A) \cup f^{-1}(B) \\
f^{-1}(A \cap B) & = f^{-1}(A) \cap f^{-1}(B) \\
f^{-1}(\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_n ) & = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f^{-1}(A_n) \\
f^{-1}(\cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_n ) & = \cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f^{-1}(A_n) \\
f^{-1}(F \setminus A) & =  f^{-1}(F) \setminus f^{-1}(A)
\end{align*}
```

<br><p></p>

```{exercise}
Check Proposition \@ref(prp:propinvimage)
```
<br><p></p>

```{corollary}
Taking the preimages of elements of a $\sigma$-algebra defines a
$\sigma$-algebra.
```



```{exercise}
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\Omega', \mathcal{G})$ be two measurable spaces.
Let $f$ map $\Omega$ to $\Omega'$, prove that
$$\mathcal{H} = \Big\{ f^{-1}(B) : B \in \mathcal{G}\Big\}$$
is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $f^{-1}(\Omega')$.
```

<p>


```{definition, measfunc, name="Measurable functions"}
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $(\Omega', \mathcal{G})$ be two measurable spaces.
A function $f: \Omega \to \Omega'$ is said to be $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{G}$-measurable iff for $B \in \mathcal{G}$,
$f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}$.
```

<p>


Under which condition on $\mathcal{H}$ is $f$ $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{G}$-measurable?


```{example}
Recall the idealized hashing scenario from Section \@ref(hashing).
```

```{exercise}
Check that if $\Omega$ is a topological space and $\mathcal{F}$ the associated
Borelian $\sigma$-algebra,  then any continuous function from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$

```{exercise}

```

```{proposition limmeasurable}
The pointwise limit of measurable functions is a measurable function:
if $(f_n)_n$ is a sequence of measurable functions from $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$
to $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{G})$, and $f_n \to f$ pointwise, then $f$ is a measurable function.
```

```{proposition summeasurable}
The sum of measurable functions is a measurable function:
if $f, g$ are  measurable functions from $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$

($g \circ f(\omega) = g(f(\omega))$ for all $\omega$)
is a measurable function from $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ to $(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{H})$.

## The Monotone class theorem  {#dynkin}

The monotone class theorem or lemma is a powerful example of the generating class arguments
that can be used to prove that two probability measures or maybe two
$\sigma$-finite measures are equal.


```{definition, name="pi-class"}
A collection $\mathcal{G}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is said to be a
$\pi$-class if:

- $\Omega \in \mathcal{G}$
- it is stable/closed by finite intersection
$$A, B \in \mathcal{G} \Rightarrow A \cap B \in \mathcal{G} \, .$$

```

<p>

A $\sigma$-algebra is a  $\pi$ class, but the converse is false.

<p>

```{definition, name="Monotone class"}
A collection $\mathcal{M}$ of subsets of $\Omega$ is said to be
a monotone class or a  $\lambda$-system if it satisfies the following properties:

- $\Omega \in \mathcal{M}$
- If $A, B \in \mathcal{M}$, and $A \subseteq B$ then $B \setminus A \in \mathcal{M}$
- If $A_n \in \mathcal{M}$ and $A_n \subseteq A_{n+1}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$
then $\lim_n A_n = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n \in \mathcal{M}$.

```

<p>
A $\sigma$-algebra is a $\lambda$-system.

<p>

The intersection of a collection of  $\lambda$-systems is a $\lambda$-system.
Hence, it makes sense to talk about the smallest $\lambda$-system
containing a collection of sets.

<p>

The next easy proposition makes $\lambda$-system very useful when
we want to check that two probability distributions are equal.


```{proposition keyobservation}
The class of sets over which two probability distributions coincide is a
$\lambda$-system.
```


<p></p>


```{proof}
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. Let $P, Q$ be two probability
distributions over $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Let $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ be defined by
\[
\mathcal{C} = \Big\{ A : A \in \mathcal{F},  P(A)=Q(A) \Big\} \, .
\]
By the very definition of measures we have $P(\Omega)=Q(\Omega)$, hence $\Omega \in \mathcal{C}$.

If $A \subseteq B$ both belong to $\mathcal{C}$, again by the very definition of measures,
\[
P (B \setminus A) = P(B) - P(A) = Q(B) - Q(A) = Q(B \setminus A) \, ,
\]
hence, $B\setminus A \subseteq \mathcal{C}$.

Let $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq A_n \subseteq \ldots$ be a non-decreasing sequence of elements of $\mathcal{C}$,
again by the very definition of measures,
\[
P(\cup_n A_n) = \lim_n \uparrow P(A_n) = \lim_n \uparrow Q(A_n) = Q(\cup_n A_n) \, .
\]
Hence $\mathcal{C}$ is closed by monotone limits.

```{remark}
What happens if we consider the collections of measurable sets over which two measures
are equal? What happens if we assume that the two measures are finite?
```


```{definition sigfinite, name="sigma-finite measures"}
A measure $\mu$
on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ is $\sigma$-finite iff there exists $(A_n)_n$ with $\Omega \subseteq \cup_n A_n$
and $\mu(A_n) < \infty$ for each $n$. Finite measures (this encompasses  probability measures) are $\sigma$-finite.
Lebesgue measure is $\sigma$-finite. The counting measure on $\mathbb{R}$ is not $\sigma$-finite.
```

What happens
if we only assume that the two measures are $\sigma$-finite?

```{theorem  monotoneclasslemma, name="Monotone class lemma"}
If $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\pi$-systen in $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{M}$ a $\lambda$-system
in $\Omega$ such that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$, then
the  $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$, $\sigma(A)$, is the smallest $\lambda$-system
larger than $\mathcal{A}$:
$$\sigma(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{M} \,.$$

```

<p></p>

```{proof}
Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the intersection of all monotone classes that contain
tyhe $\pi$-system $\mathcal{A}$.
As a $\sigma$-algebra is a monotone class (a $\lambda$-system), we have $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{A})$, the only point that
has to be checked is $\sigma(\mathcal{A}) \subseteq \mathcal{M}$. It is enough to check
that $\mathcal{M}$ is indeed a $\sigma$-algebra.

In order to check that $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra, it is enough to check that
it is closed under finite union or equivalently under finite intersection.

For each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, let $\mathcal{M}_A$ be defined by \[
\mathcal{M}_A = \Big\{ B : B \in \mathcal{M}, A \cap B \in \mathcal{M}\Big\} \, .
\]
Remember that $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\pi$-system, and $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{M}$,
we have $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{M}_A$. To show that $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_A$,
it suffices to show that $\mathcal{M}_A$ is a monotone class.

If $(B_n)_n$ is an increasing sequence of elements of $\mathcal{M}_A$, then
\[
(\cup_n B_n) \cap A = \cup_n \Big(\underbrace{B_n \cap A }_{\in \mathcal{M}}\Big) \, ,
\]
the right-hand-side belongs to $\mathcal{M}$ since $\mathcal{M}$ is monotone. Hence
$\mathcal{M}_A$ is closed by monotone increasing limit.


To check closure by complementation, let $B \subseteq C$ with $B, C \in \mathcal{M}_A$. As
\[
 A \cap (C \setminus B) = \Big(\underbrace{A \cap C}_{\in \mathcal{M}}\Big) \setminus \Big(\underbrace{A \cap B}_{\in \mathcal{M}}\Big)
 ) \,
\] the closure of $\mathcal{M}$ under complementation entails $A \cap (C \setminus B) \in \mathcal{M}$
and $C \setminus B  \in \mathcal{M}_A.$

Now, let $\mathcal{M}^{\circ}$ be defined as \[
\mathcal{M}^\circ = \Big\{  A : A \in \mathcal{M}, \forall B \in \mathcal{M},   A \cap B \in \mathcal{M} \Big\} \,.
\]
We just established that $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{M}^{\circ}$.
Using the same line of reasoning allows us to check that $\mathcal{M}^\circ$ is also a monotone class.
This shows that $\mathcal{M}^\circ= \mathcal{M}$.

We are done.

Combining Proposition \@ref(prp:keyobservation) and the Monotone Class Lemma (Theorem \@ref(thm:monotoneclasslemma))
leads to the next useful corollary.

<br><p></p>



```{corollary}
If two probabilities $P, Q$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$
coincide on a  $\pi$-system $\mathcal{A}$
that generates $\mathcal{F}$:
\[
\mathcal{A} \subseteq \{ A : A \in \mathcal{F}  \text{ and } P(A)=Q(A)\} \qquad\text{and} \qquad \mathcal{F} \subseteq \sigma(\mathcal{A})
\]
then $P, Q$ coincide on $\mathcal{F}$.

## Probability distributions on the real line  {#distribfun}

A probability distribution is a complex object: it maps a large collection of
sets (a $\sigma$-algebra) to $[0,1]$. Fortunately, it is possible
to characterize a probability distribution by simpler object. If we focus on
probability distributions over $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$,
they can be characterized by real functions on $\mathbb{R}$.


```{definition distrib-fun, name="Distribution function"}
Given a probability distribution $P$ on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$,
the distribution function
$F$ of $P$ maps $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$, it is defined by
\[
x \mapsto F(x) = P(-\infty, x].
\]

```

A probability distribution defines a unique distribution function. What is perhaps surprising
is that a distribution function defines a unique probability distribution function.

```{proposition prop-distrib-function}
Let $F$ be a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$.

The function $F$ is the distribution function of a probability distribution on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$, iff the following five properties are satisfied:

1. $F$ is non-decreasing,
1. $F$ is right-continuous
1. $\lim_{y \nearrow x} F(y)$ exists at every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ ($F$ has left-limits everywhere)
1. $\lim_{x \to -\infty}F(x)=0$
1. $\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x)= 1.$

```

This is a rephrasing of  Theorem \@ref(thm:dudley3-1-3).

Figure \@ref(fig:distribpoisson) shows the cumulative distribution function
of Poisson distributions for different values of the parameter (see Sections \@ref(conv2poisson)
and \@ref(poisson) for more on Poisson distributions).
For parameter $\mu$, $F_{\mu}(x) = \sum_{k \leq x}  \mathrm{e}^{-\mu} \frac{\mu^k}{k!}$.


(ref:distribpoisson) Cumulative distribution functions for Poisson distributions with different
parameters. Observe that, apparently, $\mu \leq \nu \Rightarrow F_{\mu} \geq F_{\nu}$. How would
you establish this domination property?


```{r distribpoisson, fig.cap="(ref:distribpoisson)", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, }

x = as.integer(seq(0, 20, by=1))
lambdas =  c(1, 5, 10)

## General random variables  {#randomvariablesperse}

A real random variable is neither a variable, nor random.
A real random variable is a measurable function from
some measurable space to the real line endowed with the
Borel $\sigma$-algebra. There is nothing random in a random variable.

```{definition,  realrv, name="Real valued random variable"}
Given a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathbb{F})$,
a mapping $X$ from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is a real valued
random variable such that for every $B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$
the inverse image of $B$:
\[
X^{-1}(B) = \{ \omega : \omega \in \Omega, X(\omega) \in {B}\}
\]
belongs to $\mathcal{F}$
```



Once a measurable space is endowed with a probability distribution,
is it possible
to define the (probability) distribution of a random variable.


```{definition disrv}

Given $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ and a real valued random variable $X$,
the law or probability distribution of $X$, denoted by $P \circ X^{-1}$, is the probability
distribution on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$  defined by
\[
(P \circ X^{-1})(B) =  P(X^{-1}(B)) \quad \text{for all } B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}).
\]

```



Random variables may be vector-valued, function-valued, _etc_.
General random variables are defined as measurable functions
between measurable spaces.

```{definition rv, name="Random variable"}
Given two  measurable spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$, and $(\Omega', \mathcal{G})$
a mapping $X$ from $\Omega$ to $\Omega'$ is a $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{G}$-random variable if
for every $B \in \mathcal{G}$ the inverse image of $B$:
\[
X^{-1}(B) = \{ \omega : \omega \in \Omega, X(\omega) \in {B}\}
\]
belongs to $\mathcal{F}$.
```

## Bibliographic remarks  {#bibliolanguage}

There are many beautiful books on Probability Theory. They are targetted at
different audiences. Some may be more suited to the students of the dual curriculum
[Mathématiques-Informatique ](http://master.math.univ-paris-diderot.fr/annee/m1-mi/).
I found the following ones particularly useful.

[Youssef (2019)](https://www.lpsm.paris/pageperso/youssef/Enseignement_files/M1-proba-2018.pdf)
is a clear and concise collection of class notes designed for a Master I-level Probability course
that is substantially more ambitious than this minimal course.


@MR1932358 delivers a self-contained course on Analysis and Probability. The book can serve
both as an introduction and a reference book. Beyond cautious and transparent proofs, it
contains historical notes that help understand the connections between landmark results.


@MR1873379 introduces measure and integration theory to an audience that has been
exposed to discrete probability theory and that is familiar with probabilistic
reasoning.
